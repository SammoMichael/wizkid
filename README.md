## Inspiration
###We wanted to make a fun game to get kids used to reading and writing code!
## What it does
###It combines a speed-typing prompt with a platformer-style 2D animation with projectile attacks
## How we built it
### MERN Google App Engine JavaScript CSS3 HTML5 
## Challenges we ran into
### Mostly my computer getting overheated and webpack getting tired of bundling for me :(
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
### Proud of making a great game to get kids into coding!
## What we learned
### We learned how difficult it can be to write python code that makes sense to kids but still compiles into actual code!
## What's next for WizKid
### More levels and stage design, more prompts and languages, more music. It would be great to build it out into a full game with tutorials and individualized it for users with an avatar and track their metrics to measure their improvement!
